## CI secrets for TestFlight (GitHub Actions)

The Deploy to TestFlight workflow expects these secrets:

- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_TEAM_ID`
- `MATCH_PASSWORD`
- `MATCH_GIT_URL`
- `MATCH_GIT_BASIC_AUTHORIZATION` (Base64 of `x-access-token:<PAT>` for the Match repo)
- `MATCH_GIT_BRANCH` (defaults to `master`; set to `main` if your Match repo uses it)

You can generate `MATCH_GIT_BASIC_AUTHORIZATION` like this (do **not** commit the output):

```sh
printf 'x-access-token:%s' "$PAT" | base64
```

If your certificates repository uses a branch other than `master`, set the `MATCH_GIT_BRANCH`
secret accordingly (for example, `main`).
